# Short presentation of `nimble`

First, a very good reference: https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-welcome-nimble.html

The `nimble` package is:

- A system for writing statistical models flexibly (based on bugs).
- A library of inference algorithms (MCMC, Laplace approximation).
- A compiler that generates and compiles C++ for your models and algorithms without knowing it is C++.

There is a `nimble` language with the basics for building statistical models (e.g. the key probability distributions, some key transformation functions).

But, this remains limited and to have full flexibility, ones need to build its own function -> can be very challenging 

# A simple example with functions being available in `nimble`
