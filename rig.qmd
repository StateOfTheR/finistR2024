`rig` is an R Installation manager that allows you to easily switch between different R versions. 

To install it, follow the instructions on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/r-lib/rig).

On ubuntu, rig will "work" with R versions installed/stored at `/opt/R/`. It will not detect the R versions installed via `apt`. If you never tried to solve this question of switching between R versions, you will need to reinstall the R versions you're interested in using rig.

To do this, use the `add` command. For example, to install R version 4.2.2:

```bash
$ rig add 4.2.2
```

After installing additional versions, you can check all the versions available on your computer using the `list` command:

```bash
$ rig list
* name   version  aliases
------------------------------------------
  4.2.2           
  4.3.3           
* 4.4.1           release
```

The '*' indicates the default version.

Then to access the desired R version in RStudio, use the rstudio command:

```bash
$ rig rstudio 4.2.2
```

Here is a command list you can use:

```bash
rig add        -- install a new R version [alias: install]
rig available  -- List R versions available to install.
rig default    -- print or set default R version [alias: switch]
rig library    -- manage package libraries [alias: lib] (experimental)
rig list       -- list installed R versions [alias: ls]
rig resolve    -- resolve a symbolic R version
rig rm         -- remove R versions [aliases: del, delete, remove]
rig rstudio    -- start RStudio with the specified R version
rig run        -- Run R, an R script or an R project
rig sysreqs    -- manage R-related system libraries and tools (experimental) (macOS)
rig system     -- manage current installations
```
